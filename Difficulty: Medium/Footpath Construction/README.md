<h2><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/footpath-construction/1?page=1&category=Arrays&sortBy=latest">Footpath Construction</a></h2><h3>Difficulty Level : Difficulty: Medium</h3><hr><div class="problems_problem_content__Xm_eO"><p>Given a matrix <strong>a</strong> of size <strong>n*m</strong> which represents a <strong>park</strong>, there is some construction work needs to be done. You are also given <strong>q</strong> queries each query contains two numbers <strong>R</strong> and <strong>C</strong>, For every query we need to construct a footpath in the <strong>Rth</strong> row and <strong>Cth</strong> column, there is a <strong>cost</strong> of this construction, after the construction this path will divide the park into <strong>sections</strong>, and the cost of the construction is the <strong>sum </strong>of <strong>minimum </strong>value present in all the sections. You are asked to find this cost for all the queries.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Elements present in queries array are according to 1-based indexing.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:<br></strong>n=3<br>m=3<br>a={{1,2,3},{4,5,6},{7,8,9}}<br>q=1<br>queries={{2,2}}<br><br><strong>Output:</strong><br>20<br><br><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>For query {2,2}, after Footpath construction, park looks like:<br><br>1 * 3<br>* * *<br>7 * 9<br><br>Here star represents footpath, Sum of minimum value present in all the remaining sections is 1+3+7+9=20</pre>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong><br>n=3<br>m=4<br>a={{1,2,3,4},{5,6,7,8},{1,2,3,4}}<br>q=1<br>queries={{3,4}}<br><br><strong>Output:</strong><br>1<br><br><strong>Explantion:</strong><br>For Query {3,4}, after Footpath construction, park looks like:<br><br>1 2 3 *<br>5 6 7 *<br>* * * *<br><br>There is only one section, sum of minimum value present in all the remaining sections is 1.</pre>
<p><strong>Your Task:</strong><br>You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function <strong>createFootpath()</strong> that takes <strong>n, m, a, q</strong> and <strong>queries</strong> as input and return an <strong>array</strong> of size <strong>q</strong> containing answer to every query as described in the problem statement.</p>
<p><strong>Expected Time Complexity:</strong> O(n*m)<br><strong>Expected Space Complexity:</strong> O(n*m)</p>
